In Chapter \@ref(programming-concepts) we introduced the concept of a data frame: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. We used the ideas behind data frames in Chapter \@ref(nycflights13) when we introduced the `flights` data frame (included in the `nycflights13` package) and in Chapter \@ref(viz) we made grarphics using data stored in data frames.

In this chapter, we extended some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called "tidy" data. You will see that having data stored in "tidy" format is about more than what the colloquial definition of the term "tidy" might suggest: having your data neatly organized in a spreadsheet. Instead, we use the term "tidy" in a much more rigorous fashion, outlining a set of rules by which data can be stored and the implications of these rules on your analyses.

Although knowledge of this type of data formatting was not necessary in our treatment of data visualization in Chapter \@ref(viz) since all the data was already in tidy format, we'll see going forward that having tidy data will allow you to more easily create data visualizations in a wider range of settings. Furthermore, it will also help you with data wrangling in Chapter \@ref(wrangling) and in all subsequent chapters in this book when we cover regresion and discuss statistical inference.

## What is tidy data?

You have surely heard the word "tidy" in your life:

- "Tidy up your room!"
- "Please write your homework in a tidy way so that it is easier to grade and to provide feedback."
- Marie Kondo's best-selling book [_The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1469400636&sr=8-1&keywords=tidying+up)
- "I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'" - Linda Grant

What does it mean for your data to be "tidy"? Beyond just being organized, in the context of this book, "tidy" data means that your data follows a standardized format. This makes it easier for you and others to visualize your data, to wrangle/transform your data, and to model your data.

We will follow Hadley Wickham's definition of **tidy data** here [@tidy]:

> A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if
qualitative). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an
observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like
height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on
the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.

> Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is
messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations,
variables and types. In **tidy data**:

> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r tidyfig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tidy data graphic from http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-1.png")
```

This format of data is also known as "long" format. Reading over this definition, you can begin to think about datasets that won't follow this nice format.

## How is `flights` tidy?

Recall the `flights` data frame included in the `nycflights13` package from Chapter \@ref(nycflights13). Run `View(flights)` in your console. We see that `flights` has a rectangular shape with each row corresponding to a different flight and each column corresponding to a characteristic of that flight.  This matches exactly with how Hadley Wickham defined tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.

But what about the third property?

> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

We identified earlier that the observational unit in the `flights` dataset is an individual flight.  And we have shown that this dataset consists of `r format(nrow(flights), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE, trim = TRUE)` flights with `r ncol(flights)` variables.  In other words, some rows of this dataset don't refer to a measurement on an airline or on an airport.  They specifically refer to characteristics/measurements on a given **flight** from New York City in 2013.  

By contrast, also included in the `nycflights13` package are datasets with different observational units [@R-nycflights13]:

- `weather`: hourly meteorological data for each airport
- `planes`: construction information about each plane
- `airports`: airport names and locations
- `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names

You may have been asking yourself what `carrier` refers to in the `glimpse(flights)` output above.  The `airlines` dataset provides a description of this with each airline being the observational unit:

```{r}
data(airlines)
airlines
```

As can be seen here when you just enter the name of an object in R, by default it will print the contents of that object to the screen.  Be careful!  It's usually better to use the `View()` function in RStudio since larger objects may take awhile to print to the screen and it likely won't be helpful to you to have hundreds of lines outputted.

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`** `weather`, `planes`, `airports`, `airlines` data sets.

The observational units, i.e. what each row corresponds to:

* `weather`: weather at a given `origin` (EWR, JFK, LGA) for a given hour i.e. `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`
* `planes`: a physical aircraft
* `airports`: an airport in the US
* `airlines`: an airline company
```
***

### Identification variables

There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames.  The `airports` data frame you worked with above contains data in these different kinds.  Let's pull them apart using the `glimpse` function:

```{r}
glimpse(airports)
```

The variables `faa` and `name` are what we will call *identification variables*.  They are mainly used to provide a name to the observational unit.  Here the observational unit is an airport and the `faa` gives the code provided by the FAA for that airport while the `name` variable gives the longer more natural name of the airport.  These ID variables differ from the other variables that are often called *measurement* or *characteristic* variables.  The remaining variables (aside from `faa` and `name`) are of this type in `airports`.  They don't uniquely identify the observational unit, but instead describe properties of the observational unit.  For organizational purposes, it is best practice to have your identification variables in the far leftmost columns of your data frame.

***

```{block lc3-3c, type='learncheck'}
**_Learning check_**
```

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What properties of the observational unit do each of `lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `tz`, `dst`, and `tzone` describe for the `airports` data frame?  Note that you may want to use `?airports` to get more information or go to the reference manual for the `nycflights13` package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf).

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** Provide the names of variables in a data frame with at least three variables in which one of them is an identification variable and the other two are not.  In other words, create your own tidy data set that matches these conditions.


```{asis lc3-3c-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-3')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`** See `?airports` help file

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`** Identification Variables

* In the `weather` example in LC3.8, the combination of `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`  are identification variables as they identify the observation in question.
* Anything else pertains to observations: `temp`, `humid`, `wind_speed`, etc.


```

## Normal forms of data

The datasets included in the `nycflights13` package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data.  We will see that there are ways to _merge_ (or _join_) the different tables together easily.  We are capable of doing so because each of the tables have _keys_ in common to relate one to another.  This is an important property of **normal forms** of data.  The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called **normalization**.  More information is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization).

We saw an example of this above with the `airlines` dataset.  While the `flights` data frame could also include a column with the names of the airlines instead of the carrier code, this would be repetitive since there is a unique mapping of the carrier code to the name of the airline/carrier. 

Below an example is given showing how to **join** the `airlines` data frame together with the `flights` data frame by linking together the two datasets via a common **key** of `"carrier"`.  Note that this "joined" data frame is assigned to a new data frame called `joined_flights`. The **key** variable that we frequently join by is one of the *identification variables* mentioned above.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
joined_flights <- inner_join(x = flights, y = airlines, by = "carrier")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
View(joined_flights)
```

If we `View` this dataset, we see a new variable has been created called `name`. (We will see in Subsection \@ref(rename) ways to change `name` to a more descriptive variable name.)  More discussion about joining data frames together will be given in Chapter \@ref(manip).  We will see there that the names of the columns to be linked need not match as they did here with `"carrier"`.

 **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What makes "tidy" datasets useful for organizing data?

 **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** How many variables are presented in the table below?  What does each row correspond to, or in other words, what are the observational units? (**Hint:** You may not be able to answer both of these questions immediately but take your best guess.)

students <- c(4, 6)
faculty <- c(2, 3)
kable(data_frame("students" = students, "faculty" = faculty))
```

 **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** The confusion you may have encountered in LC3.13 is a common one those that work with data are commonly presented with.  This dataset is not tidy.  Actually, the dataset in `r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")` has three variables not the two that were presented.  Make a guess as to what these variables are and present a tidy dataset instead of this untidy one given in `r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`.

 **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** The actual data presented in LC`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")` is given below in tidy data format:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
role <- c(rep("student", 10), rep("faculty", 5))
sociology <- c(rep(TRUE, 4), rep(FALSE, 6), rep(TRUE, 2), rep(FALSE, 3))
school_type <- c(rep("Public", 6), rep("Private", 4), rep("Public", 3), rep("Private", 2))
kable(data_frame("role" = role, `Sociology?` = sociology,
  `Type of School` = school_type))
```

- What does each row correspond to?  
- What are the different variables in this data frame?  
- The `Sociology?` variable is known as a logical variable.  What types of values does a logical variable take on?

 **`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc <- lc + 1), ")")`** What are some advantages of data in normal forms?  What are some disadvantages?


```{asis tidy_review-solutions, include=show_solutions('3-3')}
**Learning Check Solutions**  
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 5), ")")` What are common characteristics of “tidy” datasets?** Rows correspond to observations, while columns correspond to variables.  

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 4), ")")` What makes “tidy” datasets useful for organizing data?** Tidy datasets are an organized way of viewing data. We'll see later that this format is required for the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages for data visualization and manipulation.  

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 3), ")")`** There are 2 variables below, but what does each row correspond to? We don't know because there are no identification variables.  
```

```{r}
students <- c(4, 6)
faculty <- c(2, 3)
data_frame("students" = students, "faculty" = faculty) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{asis, include=show_solutions('3-3')}
**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 2), ")")`** We need at least a third variable to identify the observations. For example a variable "Department".

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc - 1), ")")`** Sociology example
 
* Each row is a member of a university.
* Variables are the columns
* `TRUE` and `FALSE`. This is called a logical variable AKA a boolean variable. `1` and `0` can also be used

**`r paste0("(LC", chap, ".", (lc), ")")`** When datasets are in normal form, we can easily `_join` them with other data sets! For example, can we join the `flights` data with the `planes` data?  We'll see this more in Chapter 4!

## What's to come?

In Chapter \@ref(viz), we will further explore the distribution of a variable in a related dataset to `flights`:  the `temp` variable in the `weather` dataset.  We'll be interested in understanding how this variable varies in relation to the values of other variables in the dataset.  We will see that visualization is often a powerful tool in helping us see what is going on in a dataset.  It will be a useful way to expand on the `glimpse` function we have seen here for tidy data.
