# Getting Started {#getting-started}

Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first (if you are already familiar with these concepts, then proceed to Chapter \@ref(viz): Data Visualization via `ggplot2`):

1. What are R and RStudio?
1. How do I code in R?
1. What are R packages?

Much of this chapter is based on two sources which you should feel free to use as references if you are looking for additional details:

1. Ismay's [Getting used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown](http://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book) [@usedtor2016], which includes GIF screen recordings that you can follow along as you learn. 
1. DataCamp's online tutorials. DataCamp is a browser-based interactive platform for learning data science and their tutorials will help facilitate your learning of the above concepts (and other topics in this book). Go to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and create an account before continuing. 





## What are R and RStudio?

First time users often confuse R and RStudio. At its simplest:

* R is like a car's engine
* RStudio is like a car's dashboard

R: Engine            |  RStudio: Dashboard 
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="images/engine.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 200px;"/>  |  <img src="images/dashboard.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="height: 200px;"/>

More precisely, R a the programming language that runs computation. RStudio is an *integrated development environment (IDE)* that provides an interface to R by adding many convenient additional features and tools. So much like trying to drive a car without a steering wheel, gas pedal, and a speedometer would be inconvenient, running R directly without using an interface like RStudio can be inconvenient. In short:

* We will be working in RStudio, which runs R in the background.
* Or stated differently, we will be using R via RStudio's interface.

Optional: For a more in-depth discussion on the difference between R and RStudio IDE, watch the following [DataCamp video (2m52s)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=1).


### Installing R and RStudio

*If your instructor has provided you with a link and access to RStudio Server, then you can skip this section. If you don't know what RStudio Server is, then please continue.*

You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. 

1. [Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
    + Note: You must do this first.
    + Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system.
1. [Download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/).
    + Scroll down to "Installers for Supported Platforms"
    + Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system.

Optional: If you need more detailed instructions on how to install R and RStudio, watch the following [DataCamp video (1m22s)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=3).


### Using R via RStudio

Recall our car analogy from above. Much as we don't drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather via the car's dashboard, we won't be using R directly but rather via RStudio. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words:

R: Do not open this          |  RStudio: Open this
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

After you open RStudio, you should see the following:

Watch the following [DataCamp video (4m10s)](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1/orientation?ex=5) to learn about the different *panes* in RStudio, in particular the *Console pane* where you will later run R code.





## How do I code in R?

Learning to code/program is very much like learning a foreign language, it can be very daunting and frustrating at first. This holds true for R just like any other programming language. However just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn. There are a few useful things to keep in mind as you learn to program:

* **Computers are stupid**: You have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, your instructions can't have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way.
* **Do not code from scratch**: Especially when learning a new language, it is often much easier to taking existing code and modify it, rather than trying to write new code from scratch.
* **Google is a coder's best friend**: Learning how to search the web effectively for programming support is a skill that needs to be developed. 

We now direct you to the following DataCamp tutorials. While these tutorials serve as an introduction to many of the basic programming concepts needed to explore data in R, they are not by themselves tools for ultimate retention. The ultimate way to learn R is to learn by doing, something we will emphasize over the course of this book.

* From the [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) course complete the following chapters:
    + [Chapter 1 Intro to basics](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-1-intro-to-basics-1?ex=1): You will familiarize yourself with the Console and learn basic programming concepts such as variables and data types.
    + [Chapter 2 Vectors](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-2-vectors-2?ex=1): You will learn about vectors, a fundamental R concept.
    + [Chapter 4 Factors](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-4-factors-4?ex=1): You will learn about how to represent categorical data as factors in R.
    + [Chapter 5 Data frames](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r/chapter-5-data-frames?ex=1): You will learn about the way spreadsheets of data are represented in R.
* From the [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) course complete the following chapters:
    + [Chapter 1 Conditionals and Control Flow](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-1-conditionals-and-control-flow?ex=1): You will learn the basic boolean algebra and logical operators for evalutaing true/false statements.
    + [Chapter 3 Functions](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r/chapter-3-functions?ex=1): You will learn about functions that take in inputs and return outputs.





## What are R packages?

An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R. They are written by a world-wide community of R users. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are the

* `ggplot2` package for data visualization in Chapter \@ref(viz)
* `dplyr` package for data wrangling in Chapter \@ref(wrangling)

However, there are two key things to remember about R packages:

1. *Installation*: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You need to install a package before you can use it. Once you've installed it, you don't need to install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version.
1. *Loading*: Packages are not loaded automatically when you open RStudio. You need to load them everytime you open RStudio.

### Package Installation

There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the `ggplot2` package:

1. In the Files pane:
    a) Click on "Packages"
    a) Click on "Install"
    a) Type the name of the package under "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" In this case, type `ggplot2`
    a) Click "Install"
1. Alternatively, in the Console pane run `install.packages("ggplot2")` (you must include the quotation marks).

Repeat this for the `dplyr` package.

**Note**: You only have to install a package once, unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version. If you want to update a package to the latest version, then re-install it by repeating the above steps.


### Package Loading

After you've installed a package, you can now load it using the `library()` command. For example, to load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages, run the following code in the Console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

**Note**: You have to reload each package you want to use every time you open a new session of RStudio.

### Data Packages

Some of the data sets we will analyze in this class are accessible via R packages. For example:

- flights leaving New York City in 2013 in the `nycflights13` package
- profiles of OKCupid users in San Francisco in the `okcupiddata` package
- IMDB movie ratings in the `ggplot2movies` package

By focusing on a few large data sources, it is our hope that you'll be able to see how each of the chapters is interconnected.  You'll see how the data being "tidy" (See Chapter \@ref(tidy)) leads into data visualization and manipulation in exploratory data analysis and how those concepts tie into inference and regression.

We will keep a running list of R packages you will need to have installed to complete the analysis as well here in the `needed_pkgs` character vector.  You can check if you have all of the needed packages installed by running all of the lines below in the next chunk of R code.  The last lines including the `if` will install them as needed (i.e., download their needed files from the internet to your hard drive and install them for your use).

You can run the `library` function on them to load them into your current analysis.  Prior to each analysis where a package is needed, you will see the corresponding `library` function in the text.  Make sure to check the top of the chapter to see if a package was loaded there.
-->
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# needed_pkgs <- c("nycflights13", "tibble", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", 
#   "okcupiddata", "dygraphs", "rmarkdown", "mosaic", 
#   "ggplot2movies", "fivethirtyeight", "readr")
# 
# new.pkgs <- needed_pkgs[!(needed_pkgs %in% installed.packages())]
# 
# if(length(new.pkgs)) {
#   install.packages(new.pkgs, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
# }
```







## Conclusion

We've given you what we feel are the most essential concepts to know before you can start exploring data in R. Is this chapter exhaustive? Absolutely not. To try to include everything in this chapter would make the chapter so large it wouldn't be useful! However, as we stated earlier, the best way to learn R is to learn by doing. Now let's get into learning about how to create good stories about and with data. In Chapter \@ref(viz), we start with what we feel is the most important tool in a data scientist's toolbox: data visualization.
