## Correlation is not causation

+ Correlation is not causation
    + Confounding variables
    + Shoes on vs waking up with headache
    
## Simple linear regression

+ Implement `tidy`, `augment`, and `glance` in `broom` package to get results
   
- Y = Arrival delay, X = departure delay for Alaskan flights 
- Skipped computing b0 and b1
- Contrasting correlation coeff vs slope
- Interpreting b1
- Build standard error by shuffling y based on x under the null
- Bootstrap points (Hesterberg)
- Interpreting table of results
    -  P-value: H0: beta1 = 0 vs !=0
    - CI: Range of plausible
R-squared
broom:tidy() to show regression output tables
Other broom functions (augment and glance)
Residual analysis?
  Showed a histogram of residuals to convey that
    Centered at 0
    Have no systematic pattern
