# ModernDive 0.1.1.9000

# ModernDive 0.1.1

* Fixed the problems of chapter cross-references not working by removing the backticks in chapter names
    + Issue created on `bookdown` [here](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/294)
* Looked for typos throughout all chapters
* Added coggle diagrams to Chapter 4 and Appendix B
* Followed the same format of having a Conclusion section at the end of each chapter
* Fixed $T$ distribution plot with histogram in Chapter 7
    + May be weird issue with `cache = TRUE` that incorrectly plotted values on 1/10^th^ the correct scale
    + Will need to keep an eye on it going forward


# ModernDive 0.1.0

* Basic chapter structure in place
* First pass at II Inference section (Chapters 6-9) complete
* First revisions of I Data Exploration (Chapters 3-5) nearly complete
