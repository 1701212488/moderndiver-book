In this chapter we will introduce new concepts that will serve as the basis for the remainder of the text:  **sampling**.  We will see that the tools that you learned in the Data Exploration portion of this book (data visualization, "tidy" data format, and data wrangling) will also play an important role here.  As mentioned before, the concepts throughout this text all build into a culmination allowing you to create better stories with data.

We begin with some helpful definitions related to sampling that form the theoretical underpinnings of statical inference, which we will cover in the upcoming "Hypothesis Testing" and "Confidence Intervals", and when we revisit regression.

## Experiment

Consider the following tub o' balls ...

```{r tub1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling 1", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling1.jpg")
```

in which we use this shovel ...

```{r tub2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling 2", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling2.jpg")
```

to extract this sample ...

```{r tub3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Sampling 3", purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling3.jpg")
```

Here are the 11 sets of counts based on samples of size $n=50$.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
responses <- read_csv("data/sampling_responses.csv") %>% 
  mutate(n=red+white+green) %>% 
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var="ID")
# kable(responses)

responses <- responses %>%
  slice(2:n()) %>%
  mutate(prop_red = red/50) %>% 
  mutate(ID=1:n())
# kable(responses)
```


| |Group                     | red| white| green|  n|
|:------------|:-------------------------|---:|-----:|-----:|--:|
|1            |Hannah and Siya           |  15|    33|     0| 48|
|2            |Kathleen and Max          |  18|    32|     0| 50|
|3            |Sean, Jack, and CJ        |  18|    32|     0| 50|
|4            |Orianna and Judy          |  22|    28|     0| 50|
|5            |James and Jacob           |  21|    29|     0| 50|
|6            |Hannah and Siya           |  16|    34|     0| 50|
|7            |Niko, Sophie, and Caitlin |  14|    36|     0| 50|
|8            |Niko, Sophie, and Caitlin |  19|    31|     0| 50|
|9            |Aleja and Ray             |  20|    30|     0| 50|
|10           |Yaw and Drew              |  16|    34|     0| 50|
|11           |Yaw and Drew              |  21|    29|     0| 50|

The first row only had $n=48$, so let's scrap this one (sorry Hannah and Siya)!
So we have 10 samples of size $n=50$. Let's look at the sample proportion of the $n=50$
balls that were red.

| |Group                     | red| white| green|  n| prop_red|
|--:|:-------------------------|---:|-----:|-----:|--:|--------:|
|  1|Kathleen and Max          |  18|    32|     0| 50|     0.36|
|  2|Sean, Jack, and CJ        |  18|    32|     0| 50|     0.36|
|  3|Orianna and Judy          |  22|    28|     0| 50|     0.44|
|  4|James and Jacob           |  21|    29|     0| 50|     0.42|
|  5|Hannah and Siya           |  16|    34|     0| 50|     0.32|
|  6|Niko, Sophie, and Caitlin |  14|    36|     0| 50|     0.28|
|  7|Niko, Sophie, and Caitlin |  19|    31|     0| 50|     0.38|
|  8|Aleja and Ray             |  20|    30|     0| 50|     0.40|
|  9|Yaw and Drew              |  16|    34|     0| 50|     0.32|
| 10|Yaw and Drew              |  21|    29|     0| 50|     0.42|


Ehhhhh, this is hard to digest. Let's visualize:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 1.5*9/2}
p <- 700/2400
sampling_distribution <- ggplot(responses, aes(x=prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +
  labs(x="Proportion red in sample of size n=50", y="Number of samples",
       title="Proportion red in 10 samples of size n=50")
sampling_distribution
```

What was the true proportion? I asked Professor X, who replied "From what I recall it was 2400 balls total, 1600 white, 100 green, so 700 red? But that's assuming we didn't lose any." In other words, the true proportion $p=\frac{700}{2400} = 0.2916$. Let's plot this.





## Definitions

1. Observational unit
1. Population
1. Population parameter
1. Sample
1. Sampling
1. Representative sampling
1. Generalizability
1. Bias
1. Statistic
1. Point estimates/sample statistics
1. Census

Moral:

* We use sampling when it is too expensive/tiring to conduct a *census*. Thus, we
need to guess at the value of the population parameter using a point estimate
based on a sample of size $n$.
* When sampling is done at random, or in other words in an unbiased fashion, the
sample is representative of the population
* When the sample is representative of the population, then any results based on 
the sample generalize to the entire population. 
* When any results based on the sample generalize to the entire population, the
point estimate/sample statistic is a "good" guess of the population parameter.





## Representative sampling

Do the following

* Identify the population of interest and what you want to know about them.
* Comment on the representativeness of the sampling procedure

for the following 5 scenarios:

1. You go to the homepages of CNN and Fox News, and see the results of online polls they both conducted directly on their website on US attitudes towards gun control.
1. Imagine it's World War II. The Royal Air Force wants to study how resistant their airplanes are to bullets. They study the bullet holes on all the airplanes on the tarmac after an air battle against the Luftwaffe (German Air Force).
1. You want to know the average income of graduates of your academic institution in the last 10 years.  So you get the records of 10 randomly chosen alumni.  They all answer and you take the average.
1. Imagine it's 1993 i.e. almost all households have landlines.  You want to know the average number of people in each household in your hometown.  You randomly pick out 500 phone numbers from the phone book and conduct a phone survey.
1. You want to know the prevalence of illegal downloading of TV shows among students at an academic institution.  You get the emails of 100 randomly chosen students and ask them "How many times did you download a pirated TV show last week?"


Other examples of sampling bias

### Kinsey Reports

In the mid 20th century, biologist/sexologist Alfred Kinsey wanted to study human sexuality. At the time sexuality was an extremely taboo subject, very little research had been conducted at that point and Kinsey was astonished at the public's general ignorance.  

What type of questions was Kinsey interested in?  Using his 300 question survey, he hoped to address...

* What percentage of Americans engaged in premarital and extramarital sex?
* What were the homosexual tendencies of American males?
* How common were oral sex and masturbation?

The results were published two books on human sexual behavior known as the ``Kinsey Reports'': Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Female (1953).

</center>

Kinsey claimed, among other things

* 85% of white men had had premarital sex, 50% had had extra-marital sex
* Kinsey wrote in 1948 that \blue{one in ten} white men were more or less, exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55.
* Kinsey reported that oral sex was very common (70% of couples did it), masturbation was very common (almost 63%/92% of women/men did it)

Needless to say, people were taken quite aback. There was also a huge conservative backlash against the reports.  However, what were his data collection methods?  How did he sample his data? Focusing on the male report, our understanding is that 

* He did in fact base his conclusions on a very large sample size of 5300 males.
* He sought out volunteers to answer his 300 question survey.
* He recruited new people by asking previous respondents if they knew other people.  This led to a large proportion of his sample to include prison populations and male prostitutes.  

The American Statistical Association criticized the sampling procedure.  In particular, John Tukey, one of the most eminent statisticians of the time, said:

> A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey.

Even though the Kinsey Report was groundbreaking and contributed much to the field of sexology by bringing many topics to the forefront, Kinsey's statements were not generalizable to the general US populations.
